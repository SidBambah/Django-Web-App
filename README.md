## Eat-List Web Application

Eat-List is a robust web application created using the Python Django web framework.

Fundamentally, Eat-List allows a user to search for nearby restaurants in his preferred cuisine type. Using the Google
Maps and places APIs, this application highlights the three highest rated restaurants distinctly on the map.

A user is able to create an account and save a list of his favorite restaurants.

In future releases, users will be able to share their favorite restaurants with their friends.
